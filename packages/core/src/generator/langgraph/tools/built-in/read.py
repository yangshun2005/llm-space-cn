    """Reads a file from the local filesystem, returning contents with line numbers.

    Reads a file from the local filesystem. Use when you need to inspect source
    code, config, or any text file. Returns file contents with line numbers; for
    images, returns a text placeholder with the file's size rather than the image
    itself. Reads the whole file by default; pass offset/limit to read a specific
    line range. Output is capped at 256KB and truncated beyond that. Prefer this
    over bash for reading files. Do NOT use read to load a skill's SKILL.md — use
    the skill tool instead, unless you specifically need to edit that skill.

    Args:
        description: Must be the first parameter in the tool call. A short
            human-readable summary explaining why this file is being read.
        path: Absolute path to the file to read. A leading ~/ is expanded to
            the current user's home directory.
        offset: 1-based line number to start reading from. Defaults to 1 (the
            first line).
        limit: Maximum number of lines to read from offset. Defaults to unlimited
            (the rest of the file), still capped by the 256KB output limit.
