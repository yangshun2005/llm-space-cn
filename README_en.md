[**LLM Space** v4](https://github.com/deer-flow/llm-space) is a desktop app for agent builders — prototype your next agent ideas, inspect every step of your harness execution, debug failures, and evaluate performance, all in one place.

**Official website:** https://deer-flow.github.io/llm-space/

LLM Space is a sister project of [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow), and we dogfood it heavily: every version of DeerFlow is built and debugged with LLM Space. The project started in March 2023, and v4 is its fourth major iteration.

## Features

- **Build** — write and version your prompts, system messages, tools, and model settings.
- **Trace** — see every model call and tool run inside the agent loop as it happens.
- **Debug** — replay a run from history and step through it to find what went wrong.
- **Evaluate** — measure how your agent performs across runs.
- **Manage** — keep your threads organized as files on your own machine.
- **Generate** — let AI write your prompt and tools for you, and even turn any thread into a runnable [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) agent.

Your files and API keys stay on your local computer. LLM Space collects a small amount of anonymous usage data to improve the app - see [TELEMETRY.md](./TELEMETRY.md) for exactly what is collected and how to opt out.

## Tech stack

- **Language & tooling** — TypeScript, built and managed with [Bun](https://bun.com).
- **Desktop shell** — [Electrobun](https://electrobun.dev), a lightweight way to ship a native app.
- **UI** — React with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- **Agent framework** — [Pi Agent Core](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), a lightweight agent framework for building agents.

## Project layout

LLM Space is a Bun monorepo:

```
packages/
  core/       # Shared domain types, clients, storage, and generators
  runtime/    # Local runtime, models, tools, skills, MCP, and Plugins
  ui/         # Shared React design system and Thread Playground
apps/
  desktop/    # The desktop app (Electrobun shell + React UI)
examples/
  atlas-plugin/ # Complete Plugin example covering every Extension type
```

Each package keeps tests in a `tests/` directory beside `src/`. Test paths
mirror source paths, such as `packages/core/src/thread/history.ts` and
`packages/core/tests/thread/history.test.ts`.

## Download

Grab a DMG from the [latest release](https://github.com/deer-flow/llm-space/releases/latest) — macOS, Apple Silicon and Intel. It comes in two editions:

- **LLM Space** — uses the system WebView. Small download (~27 MB), light on memory and battery.
- **LLM Space Performance** — embeds its own rendering engine (~130 MB). Rendering stays consistent across macOS versions, and usually performs better.

Install either, or both. They share the same `~/.llm-space` data, so switching editions keeps your threads and settings, and both update themselves in place.

## Install

Building from source? You need [Bun](https://bun.com) first. Bun is a fast, all-in-one runtime and package manager for JavaScript — think of it as a drop-in replacement for Node.js and npm. Follow the [official install guide](https://bun.com/docs/installation).

Once Bun is ready, install the project from the repo root:

```bash
bun install
```

Contributing, or want the exact toolchain CI uses? Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) and run `mise run setup` instead — it installs the locked Bun version (from `mise.lock`) plus JS deps in one step.

## Run the app

Start the desktop app for local development:

```bash
mise run dev
```

Build a canary release:

```bash
mise run build:canary
```

## User guide

The user guide lives in this repository:

- [Quick start](./docs/get-started.md)
- [User manual](./docs/index.md)
- [Core concepts](./docs/core-concepts.md)
- [Conversation compaction](./docs/compaction.md)
- [Sharing Threads](./docs/sharing.md)
- [Generating Projects](./docs/generating-projects.md)
- [Plugin development guide](./docs/plugins.md)
- [Complete Atlas Plugin example](./examples/atlas-plugin/README.md) — two
  Skills, MCP servers, model providers, Plugin Tools, Commands, and Thread
  Storages, plus a multi-field Settings schema.

## Contributing

For now, we only merge pull requests from the [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) core team members.

Everyone else is very welcome to help by [opening an issue](https://github.com/deer-flow/llm-space/issues) — bug reports, ideas, and feedback all make the project better.
